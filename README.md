# 🕹️ **2D Maze Game**  
🚀 **A challenging and interactive maze game built with Python and OpenGL!**  

## 🎯 **Project Overview**  
This **2D Maze Game** is a university project that tests your navigation skills in a dynamically generated maze. The game features **randomized mazes, power-ups, and an interactive player character** with movement controls. The goal is to reach the end of the maze while avoiding obstacles and collecting power-ups for speed boosts and invulnerability.

## 🎨 **Features**  
✅ **Random Maze Generation** – Each playthrough presents a unique maze using a recursive backtracking algorithm.  
✅ **Power-ups** – Collect special items to gain advantages like **increased speed and invulnerability**.  
✅ **Player Animation** – The character has defined body parts (head, arms, legs) and smooth movement.  
✅ **Custom Collision Detection** – Prevents passing through walls while allowing smooth navigation.  
✅ **Timer-based Challenge** – Race against the clock to complete the maze before time runs out!  
✅ **Restart, Pause & Exit Controls** – Intuitive UI buttons to control the game flow.

## 🎮 **How to Play**  
🟢 **Move the player using:**  
- `W` → Move **Up**  
- `S` → Move **Down**  
- `A` → Move **Left**  
- `D` → Move **Right**  

⚡ **Game Mechanics:**  
- **Avoid Walls** 🚧 – Touching a wall results in game over (unless invulnerable).  
- **Collect Power-ups** ✨ – Increases speed and grants temporary invulnerability.  
- **Time Management** ⏳ – Complete the maze before time runs out.  

🏆 **Winning Condition:**  
- Reach the **end of the maze** to win the game.  
- Collect power-ups to increase your final **score**.
